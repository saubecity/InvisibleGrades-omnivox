# InvisibleGrades (Omnivox support version)

⚠️ **Proof of concept script only: requires tampermonkey for now, but extension is comming** ⚠️

## NOBUYOSHI... POR QUE!!!
Parents can sometime be too strict, espicially to grades. So if ur parents sneak to your computer and get on your account to check the grades, you can hide them using this script 😝

## Features:
- Blocks access to "Lea" and its notifications
- Prevents exporting grade reports
- Fake or hide your name

## Notice
Make sure you understand the script beford executing it, as executing random scripts you find on the internet can be VERY DANGEROUS 😈😈.

## Compatibility:
Compatible with omnivox v18-v19, Tho it may work on other versions.
